iOS Questions
================================== 

These are all the iOS Specific questions we've gathered from the iOS community. Some have comments as to why the question is asked, or hints for the answer. Enjoy! And if you want a question included here, please submit a PR!

### iOS Specific

Explain different kinds of dependency injection.

Explain enums in Swift.
Explain generics in Swift.

> Shows a strong knowledge of the swift language and most industry code bases leverage these.

The `final` modifier applied to a class declaration makes the class final. 

> What are the benefits of marking a class `final`? A non-final class
> can be subclassed, and its methods can be overridden. So given a
> method of a class, that method can have different implementations in
> any of the subclasses. When a method is invoked, the runtime must
> figure out which override to call, and, as such, method invocation is
> resolved dynamically, at runtime, using a vtable. If a class is
> declared final, it cannot be subclassed, and, as such, its methods
> cannot be overridden. This means that method invocations can be
> resolved statically, at compilation time. So invoking a method on a
> final class is much faster than on a non-final, subclassable class.

Is a closure a value or a reference type?

Explain the difference between classes and structs.

> I like this question because most people know at least a surface-level
> answer, but depending on their knowledge and ability to explain things

What does `static` mean?

Why do you like Swift and what advantages or disadvantages does it have over other languages?

What is the difference between `weak` and `unowned` and when we should use which?

What is the concept of an abstract class in Swift?

Do you prefer Objective-C or Swift? Why?

Which part(s) of a framework have you explored that others have not?

When would you use `unowned` vs `weak` self in a closure?

What is Core Data?

How many possible states can a UIKit app be in and what are they?

Why do you have to update the UI on the main thread?

> It shows how deep the developer goes to discover the "why" of the
> things, and that they don't only read answers on StackOverflow.

Tell me about techniques for building UI for all device types and screen sizes. 

> I can find out what the interviewee knows about storyboards, traits
> and constraints-in-code and their relative advantages and pitfalls.

What's your opinion on using storyboards versus programmatic UI?

What's Auto Layout?

What are memory leaks and how should we avoid them?

> 1) Talking a little bit about ARC and how it works.
>
> 2) Stating the 3 main reasons for causing memory leaks which are: 
>
> ​	a) Strong relationship between 2 classes referencing each other.
> ​	b) Strong relationship between a protocol and a class (e.g. in
> delegation pattern).
> ​	c) Strong `self` inside a closure in a class.
>
> 3) To avoid them we should use `weak` or `unowned` in those cases.

How would you describe how an iOS application works to a five year old?

Explain ARC to a five year old.

How can you persist data in iOS?

What happens when I set the target of a `UIControl` to `nil`?

Tell me about `NSPredicate`.

What's the difference between nonatomic, atomic and copy?

What's the difference between strong, weak and unowned? 

> The difference between unowned and weak is that weak is declared as an `Optional` while unowned is not. By declaring it weak you get to handle the case when it might be `nil` inside the closure at some point. If you try to access an unowned variable that happens to be `nil`, it will crash the whole program. So only use unowned when you are positive that a variable will always be around while the closure is around.
> 
> An example for unowned is that a credit card will always be associated with a customer.

What is ARC?

> Weak references don't count in the reference count of an object.
> Unowned references also don't increase the object's reference count.
> Unowned references have to have a value, but weak ones can be nil.

What are closures?

What is delegation and how does it work?

> 
> https://www.andrewcbancroft.com/2015/04/08/how-delegation-works-a-swift-developer-guide/
> 
> It’s also worth noting the scope of the communication that delegation
> is intended to be used for. Whereas NSNotificationCenter fits the need
> for one instance to broadcast a message intended for more than one
> listening instance, delegation fits the scenario where an instance
> only needs to send a message to a single listener (the delegate).
